# ZEBRALANG

Following along the Book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/), I'm writing a little transpiler in go.

The author named the language `monkey`. Not wanting to go with the same name I adopted the animal theme and went with the `zebra` schema often used in my apps. This ways, I feel like I'm more inclined to give it my own spin and adapt the language as I see fit.
